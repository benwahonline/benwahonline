# Tanganyikan Missing Persons Website

This project provides a small demonstration site for tracking missing and abducted persons in Tanzania. The frontend is built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Bootstrap** using Vite. A simple Express backend serves API endpoints and the static frontend build.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install --prefix frontend
npm run --prefix frontend build
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The site includes:

- Image gallery and map of cases
- Statistics chart
- Contact form
- Login screen and dashboard (demo credentials: `admin@example.com` / `password`)
- About page describing Tanganyikan and its advocacy work
